hardcxre (pronounced "hardcore") is a cellular/genetic operating system.

what the hell is a cellular/genetic operating system?  it's a system that
supports the building and running of cellular and genetic programs.  in the
past, you would write a program for a particular purpose, with very specific
code designed to do a very narrow series of things.  in a cellular/genetic
operating environment, you don't write programs like that.  instead, you set in
motion systems whose behavior you don't fully understand.  you set in motion
emergent systems.  you define parameters of activity, rather than procedures of
activity.

building software in a cellular/genetic os is less like programming and more
like gardening.  you eschew the illusion of total control, and you open
yourself and your software to the possibility that something unexpected will
happen.  something better than you ever could have planned.

hardcxre lets you tend such gardens.

it is free, open source, and written entirely in ansi c.  its only dependency
is the standard library.  so you can use it anywhere.  to built it, just type
"make".
