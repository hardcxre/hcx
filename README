hardcxre (pronounced "hardcore") is a cellular genetic operating system.

a cellular genetic operating system is a system that supports the building and
running of cellular genetic programs.  in a process-based operating system,
you write programs for a particular purpose, with very specific code designed
to do a very narrow series of things.  in a cellular genetic operating
environment, you don't write programs like that.  instead, you set in motion
systems whose behavior you don't fully understand.  you set in motion emergent
systems.  you define parameters of activity, rather than procedures of
activity.

building software in a cellular genetic os is less like programming and more
like gardening.  you eschew the illusion of total control, and you open
yourself and your software to the possibility that something unexpected will
happen.  something better than you ever could have planned.

hardcxre helps you tend such gardens.

it is free, open source, and written entirely in ansi c.  its only dependency
is the standard library.  so you can use it anywhere.  to build it, just type
"make".
